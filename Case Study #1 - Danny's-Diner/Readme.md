<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction:</a></h1>
<p> Danny pursues his passion for Japanese cuisine by opening "Danny's Diner," a delightful restaurant that serves sushi, curry, and ramen in early 2021. However, due to a lack of data analysis experience, the restaurant fails to make informed business decisions using the minimal data obtained during its first few months. Danny's Diner wants help using this data successfully to keep the restaurant growing.</p>

<h1><a name="problemstatement">Problem Statement:</a></h1>
<p>Danny intends to use consumer data to obtain useful insights about their visit patterns, purchasing habits, and preferred menu options. By developing a stronger relationship with his consumers, he can create a more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He intends to use this information¬†to make more informed judgments about expanding the current customer loyalty program. Danny also requests assistance creating simple datasets so that his staff can easily inspect the data without¬†SQL experience.

Due to privacy concerns, he has provided a sample of his whole customer data, hoping that it will be sufficient for you to develop completely working SQL queries to answer his inquiries.

The case study revolves around three key datasets:
- Sales
- Menu
- Members</p>

<li><h5>Rank All The Things</li></h5>
<p>Danny needs additional information about the ranking of customer products. However, he specifically requires null ranking values for non-member purchases, as he is not interested in ranking customers who are not yet part of the loyalty program.</p>

```sql
WITH customers_data AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, sales.order_date,  menu.product_name, menu.price,
        CASE
            WHEN members.join_date <= sales.order_date THEN 'Y'
            ELSE 'N' 
        END AS member_status
    FROM sales
    LEFT JOIN members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    INNER JOIN menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id)
SELECT customer_id,order_date, product_name, price,member_status AS member,
    CASE
        WHEN member_status = 'N' THEN NULL
        ELSE RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, member_status ORDER BY order_date)
