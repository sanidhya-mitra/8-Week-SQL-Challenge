<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction:</a></h1>
<p> Danny pursues his passion for Japanese cuisine by opening "Danny's Diner," a delightful restaurant that serves sushi, curry, and ramen in early 2021. However, due to a lack of data analysis experience, the restaurant fails to make informed business decisions using the minimal data obtained during its first few months. Danny's Diner wants help using this data to keep the restaurant growing.</p>

<h1><a name="problemstatement">Problem Statement:</a></h1>
<p>Danny intends to use consumer data to obtain useful insights about their visit patterns, purchasing habits, and preferred menu options. By developing a stronger relationship with his consumers, he can create a more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He intends to use this information¬†to make more informed judgments about expanding the current customer loyalty program. Danny also requests assistance creating simple datasets so his staff can easily inspect the data without¬†SQL experience.

Due to privacy concerns, he has provided a sample of his whole customer data, hoping that it will be sufficient for us to develop completely working SQL queries to answer his inquiries.

The case study revolves around three key datasets:
- Sales
- Menu
- Members</p>

<h6>Logic: </h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the total amount spent (<code>total_amnt</code>) by each customer at the restaurant.</li>
  <li>It combines data from the <code>sales</code> and <code>menu</code> tables based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The query then calculates the total sum of <code>price</code> for each group of sales records with the same <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the results are sorted in ascending order based on the <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
</ul>

<li><h5></h5>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li></h5>
<br>

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS 'No. of Days' FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

<h6>Logic: </h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and counts the number of distinct order dates (<code>No. of Days</code>) for each customer.</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)</code> function calculates the number of unique order dates for each customer.</li>
  <li>Finally, the query presents the total number of unique order dates as <code>No. of Days</code> for each customer.</li>
</ul>

<li><h5>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li></h5>
  
```sql
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, 
           DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank_num, 
           m.product_name
    FROM sales s
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)
SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM CTE
WHERE rank_num = 1;

<h6>Logic: </h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named <code>CTE</code> to generate a temporary result set.</li>
  <li>Within the CTE, it selects the <code>customer_id</code>, assigns a dense rank to each row based on the order date for each customer, and retrieves the corresponding <code>product_name</code> from the <code>menu</code> table.</li>
  <li>The <code>sales</code> table is joined with the <code>menu</code> table on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The DENSE_RANK() function assigns a rank to each row within the partition of each <code>customer_id</code> based on the <code>order_date</code> in ascending order.</li>
  <li>Each <code>customer_id</code> has its partition and separate ranks based on the order dates of their purchases.</li>
  <li>Next, the main query selects the <code>customer_id</code> and corresponding <code>product_name</code> from the CTE.</li>
  <li>It filters the results and only includes rows where the rank <code>rn</code> is equal to 1, which means the earliest purchase for each <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>As a result, the query returns the first purchased product for each customer.</li>
</ul>

<li><h5>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</h5></li>

```sql
SELECT m.product_name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS most_ordered
FROM sales s
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY most_ordered DESC
LIMIT 1; 
```

<img width="200" alt="Coding" src="https://github.com/sanidhya-mitra/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's-Diner/Assets/Answer_4.png"><br>

<h6>Logic: </h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>product_name</code> from the <code>menu</code> table and counts the number of times each product was ordered (<code>most_ordered</code>).</li>
  <li>It retrieves data from the <code>Sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>menu</code> table based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>product_name</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(S.product_id)</code> function calculates the number of occurrences of each <code>product_id</code> in the <code>Sales</code> table.</li>
  <li>The query then presents the <code>product_name</code> and its corresponding count as <code>most_ordered</code> for each product.</li>
  <li>Next, the results are sorted in descending order based on the <code>most_ordered</code> column, so the most ordered product appears first.</li>
  <li>The <code>LIMIT 1</code> clause is used to restrict the result to only one row, effectively showing the most ordered product.</li>
</ul>

<li><h5>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</h5></li>

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT customer_id, 
           product_name, 
           COUNT(product_name) AS product_count,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(product_name) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM sales s
    JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
    ORDER BY customer_id, product_count DESC
) AS popularity
WHERE rnk = 1;

<h6>Logic:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query selects the <code>customer_id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, and counts the occurrences of each product for every customer, aliased as <code>product_count</code>.</li>
  <li>It employs a window function <code>DENSE_RANK()</code> partitioned by <code>customer_id</code> to assign ranks to products based on their counts within each customer group.</li>
  <li>The query retrieves data from the <code>sales</code> table and joins it with the <code>menu</code> table based on matching <code>product_id</code>.</li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code> and <code>product_name</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>COUNT(product_name)</code> function calculates the number of occurrences of each product for each customer.</li>
  <li>The window function <code>DENSE_RANK()</code> assigns a rank to each product based on its count within each customer group, ordered by descending count.</li>
  <li>Finally, the outer query filters the results to include only rows where the rank is 1, indicating the most ordered product for each customer.</li>
</ul>


<li><h5></h5>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</h5></li>

```sql

<h6>Logic:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the total points earned by each customer based on their purchases.</li>
  <li>It first selects <code>customer_id</code> and the sum of points earned (<code>total_points</code>).</li>
  <li>It employs a subquery to calculate the points earned for each purchase. Inside the subquery, it selects <code>customer_id</code>, <code>product_name</code>, <code>price</code>, and calculates the points based on the product's name:
    <ul>
      <li>If the product is 'sushi', the points are calculated by multiplying the price by 20.</li>
      <li>For all other products, the points are calculated by multiplying the price by 10.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The results of the subquery are then grouped by <code>customer_id</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the outer query calculates the sum of points for each customer by summing up the points earned from all their purchases.</li>
  <li>The results are then ordered by <code>customer_id</code> to organize the data in ascending order of customer IDs.</li>
</ul>


<li><h5>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?</h5></li>

<h6>Logic:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>The SQL query calculates the total points earned by each customer based on their purchases, considering different conditions for point calculation.</li>
  <li>It first creates a common table expression (CTE) named <code>dates_cte</code> to calculate some date-related values for each customer, including their join date, a valid date 6 days after joining, and the last day of the month of joining.</li>
  <li>The main query selects <code>customer_id</code> and calculates the total points earned (<code>points</code>) for each customer.</li>
  <li>It uses a <code>CASE</code> statement to determine the points earned for each purchase, considering the following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>If the product purchased is 'sushi' or the order date is within 6 days of joining, the points are calculated by multiplying the price by 20.</li>
      <li>For all other products or purchases made beyond the first 6 days after joining, the points are calculated by multiplying the price by 10.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The results are grouped by <code>customer_id</code> to calculate the total points earned by each customer.</li>
  <li>Finally, the results are ordered by <code>customer_id</code> to organize the data in ascending order of customer IDs.</li>
