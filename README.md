# 8 Week SQL Challenge

## Introduction: 

Welcome to my SQL journey! This repository showcases my SQL proficiency through a series of eight entertaining case studies titled the **#8WeekSQLChallenge**. Each case study provides a distinct problem-solving scenario that necessitates the use of various SQL approaches such as:

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**
- **Window Function**
- **SQL JOINS**
- **Datetime Functions**
- **Aggregation**
